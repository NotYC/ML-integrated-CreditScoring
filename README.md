"# Project Initiated on 8 Feb 2025" 
# ML Integrated Credit Scoring System

Traditional credit scoring methods often rely on rigid, rule-based systems that may not accurately assess the creditworthiness of diverse individuals, particularly those with limited financial history. Such systems can lead to biased decisions, inefficiencies, and missed opportunities for financial inclusion. To address these challenges, this project proposes the development of a Machine Learning Integrated Credit Scoring System that dynamically analyzes a broad range of financial and demographic factors to generate more accurate, fair, and explainable credit scores.

The proposed system is a machine learning-driven solution designed to efficiently and accurately assess an individual's creditworthiness. It replaces traditional manual evaluation methods by leveraging advanced algorithms to analyze diverse datasets, including historical credit behavior, financial profiles, and alternative data sources such as utility payments and employment trends. By automating data preprocessing, model training, and real-time scoring, the system enables lenders, banks, and fintech platforms to make faster, data-driven lending decisions while ensuring compliance and fairness.

This solution integrates Linear Regression and XGBoost machine learning models within a web application built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), combining the predictive power of machine learning with a seamless user experience. Through this approach, the system aims to enhance the precision of credit risk assessment, reduce manual errors, and support broader, more inclusive financial decision-making.


## Features

- **User Input Form**:A detailed and user-friendly form designed to collect comprehensive personal, professional, and financial information from users. The collected data serves as the primary input for the credit score prediction process. Sections are intuitively organized to ensure ease of use and completeness, enhancing the accuracy of the final prediction.
- **Machine Learning Models**: This system incorporates multiple machine learning algorithms to ensure both accuracy and interpretability:
  - **Linear Regression**: A straightforward and easily interpretable algorithm that establishes a relationship between user-provided inputs and the predicted credit score. Ideal for providing a baseline model and offering transparent insights into how different factors influence the score.
  - **XGBoost**: An advanced and highly efficient gradient boosting algorithm known for its superior predictive performance. XGBoost enhances the system's accuracy by effectively handling complex patterns and interactions within the input data.
- **Credit Score Visualization**: Real-time prediction results are visualized through a dynamic and animated dial gauge, offering an engaging user experience. The credit score is also categorized into intuitive ratings such as Poor, Fair, Good, and Excellent, helping users quickly understand their credit standing at a glance.
- **MongoDB Integration**: TThe system seamlessly integrates with MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store all credit score predictions along with associated user details. This ensures data persistence, enabling future references, audits, and advanced analytics.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with a focus on user experience, the application features a modern, clean, and fully responsive user interface. The form is divided into clear sections including Personal Information, Professional Information, Asset Information, and a dedicated Credit Score Meter area, ensuring a smooth and organized data entry process across all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **Material-UI**: A React component library for building modern, responsive designs.
- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server.
  - **Express.js**: A web framework for Node.js to handle backend routing.
  - **Flask**: For serving the machine learning models as APIs (if running models in a separate service).
- **Machine Learning**:
  - **XGBoost**: A scalable machine learning algorithm used for gradient boosting.
  - **Linear Regression**: A basic algorithm used to predict the credit score.
- **Database**:
  - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user information and predicted credit scores.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB Compass
- Python 3.x
- Pip (for Python dependencies)
- NPM  for managing JavaScript dependencies

## Setup

### Backend (Node.js + Express)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-integrated-credit-scoring.git
   cd ml-integrated-credit-scoring
   
### ML Model (Flask)

2. Run the Flask Applicatiom
   ```bash
   cd ml-integrated-credit-scoring/PipeLine Blueprint/model side


### Instructions on how to run docker application of KYCS: 

1.Pull the latest commit upto "deleted files" into your system while on main branch

2.go to root directory of our capstone in terminal 

3.type docker-compose -up --build

4.open another terminal and go into bash of frontend "docker exec -it creditscore_frontend bash"

5.go to the local host port 5174 

6. Docker compose down once done!

It should be working now

Dont do any changes in main branch now

If you want to change to before docker integration , make branch from "credit history chart" of sarab commit.


### Docker

Individual Containers
flask 
2.  docker run -d --name flask-container -p 5003:5003 my-flask
1. docker build -t my-flask .\PipeLineBlueprint\modelside\   

frontend:
2.docker run -d --name frontend-container -p 5002:80 my-frontend
1. docker build -t my-frontend .\frontend\ 

backend:
2.  docker run -d --name backend-container --env-file ./authentication_end/.env -p 5001:5001 my-backend
1. docker build -t my-backend .\authentication_end

Once everything is working properly then only can we move to the next step that is docker-compose up --build
